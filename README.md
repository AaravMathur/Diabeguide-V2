## Browser Support

## Troubleshooting

### Brave Browser - "Connection to local database server failed"
**Issue**: Brave Shields automatically blocks port-to-port connections on `localhost` (e.g., from Vite's frontend port `5173` to the Express backend port `5000`), forcing the application into Offline Demo Mode.
* **Solution**:
  1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in Brave.
  2. Click the orange **Lion head icon** (Brave Shields) in the right side of the address bar.
  3. Toggle the Shields **OFF** for this site (the switch will change from purple to gray).
  4. Refresh the page to connect cleanly to the local backend.

### Port Already in Use
If you get a port conflict error, the dev server may already be running. Check for existing processes.

### Dependencies Not Installing
Try clearing the pnpm cache:
```bash
pnpm store prune
pnpm install
```

### Build Errors
Make sure you're using the correct Node.js version:
```bash
node --version  # Should be v18 or higher
```

## Development Notes

- This is a Figma Make project with a special build configuration
- Do NOT run `vite build` directly - use `pnpm run build`
- The entrypoint is auto-generated at runtime
- Use the preview surface instead of localhost URLs
